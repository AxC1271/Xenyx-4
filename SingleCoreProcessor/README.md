# RISC-V Single Core

Welcome to the top-level `RISC-V processor` module of this Xenyx-4 project. This module brings together all critical components‚Äîcontrol logic, arithmetic units, memory, and I/O‚Äîto form a fully functioning single core to be integrated.

## üß† Overview
The RISC-V processor module acts as the central hub for instruction execution. It connects submodules such as the program counter, control unit, ALU, register file, and data memory to process instructions based on the RISC-V ISA. It also integrates a seven-segment display and LED-based debugging support for observing runtime values like instruction count and printf outputs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality

- **Instruction Execution**: Orchestrates instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back.
- **PC Control**: Uses a clock divider to slow execution for step-by-step debugging.
- **Branching & Jumping**: Supports branching logic through multiplexers and control signals.
- **Memory Access**: Interfaces with instruction and data memory modules.
- **Display Output**: Shows memory-mapped printf-style output on a 7-segment display.
- **Instruction Count Debugging**: Uses 16 on-board LEDs to show number of executed instructions.

## üß™ Testing

Simulation and hardware debugging strategies:

## üí° Importance
This top-level module:

- Integrates and coordinates the entire RISC-V CPU pipeline.

- Provides observable hardware debugging tools.

- Enables hands-on education in ISA-level design and hardware-software integration.

- Serves as a template for expanding the CPU with pipelining, caching, or interrupt handling.
